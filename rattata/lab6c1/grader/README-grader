This directory contains the driver files for testing your compiler.

You can test your test cases with

% ../grader/gradetests [options] [suites to tests...]

You can test your compiler with

% ../grader/gradecompiler [options] [suites to test...]

For a complete list of options, use the -h flag.

Two very important flags:
 -q (or -qq, -qqq, -qqqq...) make the grader output less and less
    information.
 -j <num> makes the grader work in parallel. On a 4-core machine it
    makes sense to run the graders with the flag -j3 or -j4

DEBUGGING:
The harness is written in Standard ML and run with Standard ML of New Jersey.

If you install sml with apt-get, you may get this error message: 
/usr/lib/smlnj/bin/sml: Fatal error -- Uncaught exception Fail with
"anchor $json-lib.cm not defined" raised at
../cm/main/cm-boot.sml:169.50-169.56

This is because not all of the standard SML/NJ libraries are currently
distributed by apt-get.  A fix is available: in the root of your
group's repository, run

$ wget https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rjsimmon/15411-f15/etc/json-lib.tgz
$ tar xzvf json-lib.tgz

You can check the two directories that are generated, JSON and ml-lpt,
into your repository.
