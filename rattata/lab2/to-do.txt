Things to do for L2...

1. Lex and parse (Ben)
2. New datatypes for new assembly instructions (together)
   -test
   -compare (cmp)
   -bitwise ops (and, or, xor, negate; assumed to exist in x86-64)
   -shifts
   -logical ops (and, or, not; assumed to exist in x86-64)
   -label
   -jump
3. Elaboration: makes code simpler by splitting lines into simpler lines (Billy?)
4. Typecheck: bools are not ints in C0 because C0 is dumb (Billy??),
              checking for uninitialized vars (happens on elaborated AST)
5. Update toInfAddr (turn ifs/loops into jumps, tests, etc)
6. Update to3Addr, to2Addr, regAlloc (actually write liveness :P), toWonkyAssem, printDataTypes
